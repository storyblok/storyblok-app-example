# tmp-strblk-nuxt-auth

> Experiment for nuxt auth with storyblok

## Requirements

You need to create a ssl tunnel to test the app as Storyblok requires https. A nice tool to start such a tunnel is [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
